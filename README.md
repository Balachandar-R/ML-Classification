# ML-Classification
Classification of Request Descriptions 
In this task, features are the words (Keywords) in the description of the request raised by the user. For this, we have used Bag of Words Model (NLP) to find the frequency of the words in a description /Document and make them to classify either as a software or hardware.
Steps to follow:
1.	Preprocess the given dataset 
a.	Label the set of examples manually 
2.	Create Feature Extractor 
3.	Build the classifier 
4.	Train the Classifier with Manually labelled Dataset
5.	Test the classifier with Test Data(New description)
6.	Evaluate the performance of the classifier
